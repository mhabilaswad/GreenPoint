# üå± GreenPoint

**GreenPoint** is a Plant-based Social Media Website that enables users to upload, view, and manage images of their plants. These images are processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the plant's condition as *Healthy*, *Normal*, or *Wilting*. Users receive appreciation points based on the classification. The platform is built using **Next.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
